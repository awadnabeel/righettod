It is basically an adaptation of the GWT Eclipse plugin's sample project to the Maven environment.

The following commands should be useful:
* Run in hosted mode:
> mvn compile war:exploded gwt:run
* Compile a deployable war (all goals are included in POM configuration for easier use):
> mvn package
