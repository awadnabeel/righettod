This project have to objective to show a sample of use CRAP4J.

Crap4j is a Java implementation of the CRAP (Change Risk Analysis and Predictions) software metric – a 
mildly offensive metric name to help protect you from truly offensive code.

The CRAP metric combines cyclomatic complexity and code coverage from automated tests (e.g. JUnit tests) to 
help you identify code that might be particularly difficult to understand, test, or maintain – the kind of code that makes 
developers say: “This is crap!” or, if they are stuck maintaining it, “Oh, crap!”.
