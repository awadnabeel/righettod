This project have to objective to show samples of use of the LOMBOK PROJECT tools (http://projectlombok.org) 

** Note from the LOMBOK website ("lombok.jar" file is available in the "lib" directory) : 
Just double-click the lombok.jar file you'll download to install lombok into your IDE. 
lombok.jar is also the jar you use as a project dependency (include it in your classpath when compiling 
with javac or add it to your project library list in your java IDE). It's the only jar you need!

If double-clicking opens winrar or some other archiver, go to the command line and run
java -jar lombok.jar to start the installer.

** Run demos :
Each class starting with the prefix "Demo*" contains a Main() entry point in order to be runnable and
show a demo of the target sample...
